## Description

In the digital era, machine translation (MT) is fundamental for global communication, enhancing everything from instant translations on mobile devices to complex multilingual support in customer service centres. However, the scarcity of training data for low-resource languages like Dyula poses a significant challenge in generalising and adapting MT models to new domains.

This repository presents the a well crafted MT model based on NLLB200 600-M capable of translating content from Dyula into French across multiple domains like news articles, daily conversations, spoken dialogue transcripts, and books.This solution has been carefuuly designed to balance various trade-offs, such as latency, accuracy, throughput and cost. 
## Anticipated use case:

This contribution will target a unique use case: AI Student Learning Assistant (AISLA) - a free learning assistant that helps students converse and learn in their native language.

AISLA can support students with creating study plans, summarising course materials, and conducting question-and-answer sessions for exam preparations. AISLA can read and respond in either French or Dyula, enhancing educational accessibility for Dyula speakers by providing reliable French-to-Dyula translations. Your model will serve as a potential backbone for AISLA on Discord.
